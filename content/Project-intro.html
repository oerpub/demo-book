Be sure and add some mathematics, and some textbook semantic blocks (Note to Reader, Activity, etc.) Images encourage authors to add descriptive alternate text for learners with visual impairments and provide lots of opportunity to properly source the image.</p><p style="">To start your own book, click "Fork this Book" (copy)&nbsp;<a href="http://editor.oerpub.org/#repo/oerpub/empty-book" class="" title="">the empty-book</a>.&nbsp;<br></p><h2 id="3e8f48ac-324e-a222-11b0-57ac7b92f33d">Find out more&nbsp;</h2><p>See <strong>About the Textbook Editor</strong> in the Book Picker</p><p><br></p></body>
